## Building a neural network with tensorflow to decipher hand sign language

In this project, we built a neural network using TensorFlow to decipher hand sign language. The training dataset is labeled pictures of hand sign in front of a white wall. We built the algorithm that would facilitate communications from a speech-impaired person to someone who doesn't understand sign language.

Training set: 1080 pictures (64 by 64 pixels) of signs representing numbers from 0 to 5 (180 pictures per number).
Test set: 120 pictures (64 by 64 pixels) of signs representing numbers from 0 to 5 (20 pictures per number).
